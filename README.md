## 📖 Overview

We provide efficient and streamlined implementations of the TOFU, MUSE unlearning benchmarks while supporting 6 unlearning methods, 3+ datasets, 9+ evaluation metrics, and 6+ LLM architectures. Each of these can be easily extended to incorporate more variants.

We invite the LLM unlearning community to collaborate by adding new benchmarks, unlearning methods, datasets and evaluation metrics here to expand OpenUnlearning's features, gain feedback from wider usage and drive progress in the field.

### 📢 Updates

#### [Apr 6, 2025]
- **More Metrics!** Added 6 Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) (LOSS, ZLib, Reference, GradNorm, MinK, and MinK++), along with Extraction Strength (ES) and  Exact Memorization (EM) as additional evaluation metrics.
- **More TOFU Evaluations!** Now includes a holdout set and supports MIA attack-based evaluation. You can now compute MUSE's privleak on TOFU.
- **More Documentation!** [`docs/links.md`](docs/links.md) contains resources for each of the implemented features and other useful LLM unlearning resources.


<details>
<summary><b>Older Updates</b></summary>

#### [Mar 27, 2025]
- **More Documentation: easy contributions and the leaderboard functionality**: We've updated the documentation to make contributing new unlearning methods and benchmarks much easier. Users can document additions better and also update a leaderboard with their results. See [this section](#-how-to-contribute) for details.

#### [Mar 9, 2025]
- **More Methods!** Added support for [RMU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03218) (representation-engineering based unlearning).

#### [Feb 27, 2025]  
⚠️ **Repository Update**: This repo replaces the original TOFU codebase at [`github.com/locuslab/tofu`](https://github.com/locuslab/tofu), which is no longer maintained.

## ⚡ Quickstart

```bash
# environment setup
conda create -n unlearning python=3.11
conda activate unlearning
pip install .
pip install --no-build-isolation flash-attn==2.6.3

# data setup
python setup_data.py  # saves/eval now contains evaluation results of the uploaded models
# Downloads log files with metric eval results (incl retain model logs) from the models 
# used in the supported benchmarks.
```

### 🔄 Updated TOFU benchmark

We've updated Open-Unlearning's TOFU benchmark target models to use a wider variety of newer architectures with sizes varying from 1B to 8B. These include LLaMA 3.2 1B, LLaMA 3.2 3B, LLaMA 3.1 8B, and the original LLaMA-2 7B (re-created) target models from [the old version of TOFU](github.com/locuslab/tofu). 

For each architecture, we have finetuned with four different splits of the TOFU datasets: `full`, `retain90`, `retain95`, `retain99`, for a total of 16 finetuned models. The first serves as the target (base model for unlearning) and the rest are retain models used to measure performance against for each forget split. These models are on [HuggingFace](`https://huggingface.co/collections/open-unlearning/tofu-new-models-67bcf636334ea81727573a9f0`) and the paths to these models can be set in the experimental configs or in command-line overrides.

## 🧪 Running Experiments

We provide an easily configurable interface for running evaluations by leveraging Hydra configs. For a more detailed documentation of aspects like running experiments, commonly overriden arguments, interfacing with configurations, distributed training and simple finetuning of models, refer [`docs/experiments.md`](docs/experiments.md).

### 🚀 Perform Unlearning

An example command for launching an unlearning process with `GradAscent` on the TOFU `forget10` split:

```bash
python src/train.py --config-name=unlearn.yaml experiment=unlearn/tofu/default \
  forget_split=forget10 retain_split=retain90 trainer=GradAscent task_name=SAMPLE_UNLEARN
```

- `experiment`- Path to the Hydra config file [`configs/experiment/unlearn/tofu/default.yaml`](configs/experiment/unlearn/tofu/default.yaml) with default experimental settings for TOFU unlearning, e.g. train dataset, eval benchmark details, model paths etc..
- `forget_split/retain_split`- Sets the forget and retain dataset splits.
- `trainer`- Load [`configs/trainer/GradAscent.yaml`](configs/trainer/GradAscent.yaml) and override the unlearning method with the handler (see config) implemented in [`src/trainer/unlearn/grad_ascent.py`](src/trainer/unlearn/grad_ascent.py).

### 📊 Perform an Evaluation

An example command for launching a TOFU evaluation process on `forget10` split:

```bash
model=Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct
python src/eval.py --config-name=eval.yaml experiment=eval/tofu/default \
  model=${model} \
  model.model_args.pretrained_model_name_or_path=open-unlearning/tofu_${model}_full \
  retain_logs_path=saves/eval/tofu_${model}_retain90/TOFU_EVAL.json \
  task_name=SAMPLE_EVAL
```

- `experiment`- Path to the evaluation configuration [`configs/experiment/eval/tofu/default.yaml`](configs/experiment/eval/tofu/default.yaml).
- `model`- Sets up the model and tokenizer configs for the `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` model.
- `model.model_args.pretrained_model_name_or_path`- Overrides the default experiment config to evaluate a model from a HuggingFace ID (can use a local model checkpoint path as well).
- `retain_logs_path`- Sets the path to the reference model eval logs that is needed to compute reference model based metrics like `forget_quality` in TOFU.

For more details about creating and running evaluations, refer [`docs/evaluation.md`](docs/evaluation.md).


### 📜 Running Baseline Experiments
The scripts below execute standard baseline unlearning experiments on the TOFU and MUSE datasets, evaluated using their corresponding benchmarks. The expected results for these are in [`docs/repro.md`](docs/repro.md).

```bash
bash scripts/tofu_unlearn.sh
bash scripts/muse_unlearn.sh
```

The above scripts are not tuned and uses default hyper parameter settings. We encourage you to tune your methods and add your final results in [`community/leaderboard.md`](community/leaderboard.md).

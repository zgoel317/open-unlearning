## 📖 Overview

We provide efficient and streamlined implementations of the TOFU, MUSE unlearning benchmarks while supporting 5 unlearning methods, 3+ datasets, 6+ evaluation metrics, and 7+ LLMs. Each of these can be easily extended to incorporate more variants.

We invite the LLM unlearning community to collaborate by adding new benchmarks, unlearning methods, datasets and evaluation metrics here to expand OpenUnlearning's features, gain feedback from wider usage and drive progress in the field.

## 🗃️ Available Components

We provide several variants for each of the components in the unlearning pipeline.

| **Component**          | **Available Options** |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Benchmarks**        | [TOFU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06121), [MUSE](https://muse-bench.github.io/) |
| **Unlearning Methods** | GradAscent, GradDiff, NPO, SimNPO, DPO |
| **Evaluation Metrics** | Verbatim Probability, Verbatim ROUGE, QA-ROUGE, MIA Attacks, TruthRatio, Model Utility |
| **Datasets**          | MUSE-News (BBC), MUSE-Books (Harry Potter), TOFU (different splits) |
| **Model Families**    | LLaMA 3.2, LLaMA 3.1, LLaMA-2, Phi-3.5, ICLM (from MUSE), Phi-1.5, Gemma |

## ⚡ Quickstart

### 🛠️ Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n unlearning python=3.11
conda activate unlearning
pip install .[flash-attn]
```

### 💾 Data Setup
Download the log files containing metric results from the models used in the supported benchmarks (including the retain model logs used to compare the unlearned models against).

```bash
python setup_data.py # populates saves/eval with evaluation results of the uploaded models
```

---

## 🧪 Running Experiments

We provide an easily configurable interface for running evaluations by leveraging Hydra configs. For a more detailed documentation of aspects like running experiments, commonly overriden arguments, interfacing with configurations, distributed training and simple finetuning of models, refer [`docs/experiments.md`](docs/experiments.md).

### 🚀 Perform Unlearning

An example command for launching an unlearning process with `GradAscent` on the TOFU `forget10` split:

```bash
python src/train.py --config-name=unlearn.yaml experiment=unlearn/tofu/default \
  forget_split=forget10 retain_split=retain90 trainer=GradAscent
```

- `experiment`- Path to the Hydra config file [`configs/experiment/unlearn/muse/default.yaml`](configs/experiment/unlearn/tofu/default.yaml) with default experimental settings for TOFU unlearning, e.g. train dataset, eval benchmark details, model paths etc..
- `forget_split/retain_split`- Sets the forget and retain dataset splits.
- `trainer`- Load [`configs/trainer/GradAscent.yaml`](configs/trainer/GradAscent.yaml) and override the unlearning method with the handler (see config) implemented in [`src/trainer/unlearn/grad_ascent.py`](src/trainer/unlearn/grad_ascent.py).

### 📊 Perform an Evaluation

An example command for launching a TOFU evaluation process on `forget10` split:

```bash
python src/eval.py --config-name=eval.yaml experiment=eval/tofu/default \
  model=Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct \
  model.model_args.pretrained_model_name_or_path=open-unlearning/tofu_Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct_full
```

- `experiment`-Path to the evaluation configuration [`configs/experiment/eval/tofu/default.yaml`](configs/experiment/eval/tofu/default.yaml).
- `model`- Sets up the model and tokenizer configs for the `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` model.
- `model.model_args.pretrained_model_name_or_path`- Overrides the default experiment config to evaluate a model from a HuggingFace ID (can use a local model checkpoint path as well).

For more details about creating and running evaluations, refer [`docs/evaluation.md`](docs/evaluation.md).

### 📜 Running Baseline Experiments
The scripts below execute standard baseline unlearning experiments on the TOFU and MUSE datasets, evaluated using their corresponding benchmarks. The expected results for these are in [`docs/results.md`](docs/results.md).

```bash
bash scripts/tofu_unlearn.sh
bash scripts/muse_unlearn.sh
```

## ➕ How to Add New Components

Adding a new component (trainer, evaluation metric, benchmark, model, or dataset) requires defining a new class, registering it, and creating a configuration file. Learn more about adding new components in [`docs/components.md`](docs/components.md).

Please feel free to raise a pull request for any new features after setting up the environment in development mode.

```bash
pip install .[flash-attn, dev]
```
